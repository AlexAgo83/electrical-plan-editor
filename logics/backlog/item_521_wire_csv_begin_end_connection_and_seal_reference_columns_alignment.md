# Problem
Wire CSV exports currently stop at endpoint ID/pin plus section/length/route mode, so per-side connection and seal reference metadata is not available in exported `fil a fil` documents.

# Scope
- In:
  - add four explicit columns to Modeling and Analysis wire CSV exports:
    - `Begin connection ref`
    - `Begin seal ref`
    - `End connection ref`
    - `End seal ref`
  - keep current `Begin ID`, `Begin pin`, `End ID`, `End pin`, and route-mode behavior;
  - export blank cells when a reference is absent;
  - preserve current UTF-8 BOM behavior for wire CSV exports.
- Out:
  - changes to on-screen wire table columns;
  - endpoint domain-model redesign;
  - BOM aggregation work.

# Acceptance criteria
- AC1: Modeling wire CSV export includes the four new termination-reference columns.
- AC2: Analysis wire CSV export includes the same four columns in the same schema order.
- AC3: Values are taken from `endpointA/BConnectionReference` and `endpointA/BSealReference`.
- AC4: Missing values export as blank cells.
- AC5: Existing wire CSV UTF-8 and CSV-safety behavior remains non-regressed.

# AC Traceability
- AC1/AC2/AC3/AC4 -> `src/app/components/workspace/ModelingSecondaryTables.tsx` and `src/app/components/workspace/AnalysisWireWorkspacePanels.tsx`.
- AC5 -> `src/tests/app.ui.list-ergonomics.spec.tsx` and `src/tests/csv.export.spec.ts`.
- request-AC1 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: `Network summary` BOM CSV export uses a UTF-8-compatible download payload and preserves accented/special characters in common spreadsheet clients.
- request-AC2 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Existing catalog-backed BOM rows remain exported in the same CSV without regression to current grouping/pricing behavior.
- request-AC3 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: The same BOM CSV export includes a second `Wire terminations` section after the existing BOM content.
- request-AC4 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: The `Wire terminations` section exports aggregated rows with headers `Type`, `Reference`, `Quantity`.
- request-AC5 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: `Connection` and `Seal` references are counted separately and aggregated by `type + reference`.
- request-AC6 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Empty/whitespace-only wire-side termination references are ignored and do not create rows.
- request-AC7 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Modeling wire CSV export includes `Begin connection ref`, `Begin seal ref`, `End connection ref`, `End seal ref`.
- request-AC8 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Analysis wire CSV export includes the same four columns in the same schema order.
- request-AC9 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Current wire CSV UTF-8 and CSV-safety behavior remains non-regressed.
- request-AC10 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: `Node analysis` associated-segment rows expose a `Go to` action for each segment.
- request-AC11 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Activating `Go to` from an associated-segment row opens the `Segment` analysis sub-screen and selects the targeted segment.
- request-AC12 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Missing-segment edge cases disable the `Go to` action safely instead of failing at runtime.
- request-AC13 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: `Segment analysis` traversing-wire rows expose a `Go to` action for each wire.
- request-AC14 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Activating `Go to` from a traversing-wire row opens the `Wire` analysis sub-screen and selects the targeted wire.
- request-AC15 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Missing-wire edge cases disable the `Go to` action safely instead of failing at runtime.
- request-AC16 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Export cartouche identity metadata is no longer unnecessarily truncated for ordinary-length values such as medium-length author names when export size allows readable layout.
- request-AC17 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: SVG and PNG exports follow the same cartouche metadata readability behavior.
- request-AC18 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Both new navigation tables use the existing `Actions` column + iconized `Go to` button pattern already used in `Catalog analysis`.
- request-AC19 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: On-screen plan rendering increases label distance from the stroke for horizontal and near-horizontal segments.
- request-AC20 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Exported SVG follows the same horizontal/near-horizontal label-offset behavior as the on-screen plan.
- request-AC21 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: `logics_lint`, `lint`, `typecheck`, and relevant export/UI tests pass after implementation.

# Priority
- Impact: High.
- Urgency: High.

# Notes
- Derived from `logics/request/req_106_bom_export_wire_termination_coverage_wire_csv_termination_columns_and_horizontal_label_offset_harmonization.md`.
- Orchestrated by `logics/tasks/task_085_req_106_export_analysis_navigation_and_render_readability_orchestration_and_delivery_control.md`.
- Supplied workbook evidence:
  - current header ends at `Route mode`, confirming the four termination-reference columns are absent today.
- Risks:
  - downstream tools depending on the old column count/order may require update;
  - partial rollout to one surface only would create schema drift.

# Delivery
- Modeling and Analysis wire CSV exports now include:
  - `Begin connection ref`
  - `Begin seal ref`
  - `End connection ref`
  - `End seal ref`
- Schema order is aligned across both surfaces and missing values export as blank cells.

# Validation
- `npm test -- --run src/tests/app.ui.list-ergonomics.spec.tsx src/tests/csv.export.spec.ts`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`

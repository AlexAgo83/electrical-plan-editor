# Problem
`req_051` changes the recommended creation sequence to `catalog-first`, but onboarding currently instructs users to build connectors/splices directly. The onboarding flow must be updated to reflect the new sequence and provide contextual actions to the Catalog panels.

# Scope
- In:
  - Add a new onboarding step for `Catalog` in 2nd position (after network creation, before connector/splice library step).
  - Update onboarding progress count/labels (e.g. 5 -> 6 steps).
  - Add contextual onboarding help entry for Catalog panel (`modeling-catalog`).
  - Implement Catalog onboarding target actions (`Open/Scroll to Catalog`, optional edit panel target action).
  - Update existing `connectorSpliceLibrary` onboarding wording to reflect catalog-first workflow.
- Out:
  - Catalog domain/store implementation.
  - Connector/splice form enforcement logic.

# Acceptance criteria
- Onboarding full flow contains a new Catalog step in the correct order.
- Progress label count updates consistently.
- Catalog contextual help opens the Catalog onboarding step.
- Connector/splice onboarding wording reflects catalog-first creation.
- Onboarding target actions navigate/scroll to the correct Catalog UI context.

# Priority
- Impact: Medium-High.
- Urgency: Medium-High.

# AC Traceability
- request-AC1 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: A `Catalog` modeling sub-screen exists and is accessible from the nav bar and drawer menu.
- request-AC2 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: The `Catalog` nav entry is positioned before `Connectors` / `Splices` / other entity sub-screen entries.
- request-AC3 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: The `Catalog` workspace screen reuses the expected modeling look-and-feel and includes `Network summary`, `Route preview`, `Catalog`, and `Edit catalog item` panels.
- request-AC4 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: The catalog screen does not render the analysis panel/column.
- request-AC5 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: `Manufacturer reference` is mandatory to save a catalog item.
- request-AC6 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: `Connection count` is mandatory to save a catalog item.
- request-AC7 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: `Name`, `Unit price (excl. tax)`, and `URL` are supported as optional inputs.
- request-AC8 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Legacy saves with connectors/splices using `manufacturerReference` are backfilled into `Catalog` (using manufacturer ref + way/port count -> `connectionCount`) without duplicate churn.
- request-AC9 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Connector/Splice forms use a catalog-backed manufacturer selector instead of free-text manufacturer reference.
- request-AC10 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Connector `way` count and Splice `port` count are derived from the selected catalog item `connectionCount`.
- request-AC11 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: New connector/splice creation follows a `catalog-first` workflow (catalog item created/selected first), with legacy entities still supported via fallback resolution.
- request-AC12 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Onboarding includes a new `Catalog` step in 2nd position (before the connectors/splices library step) with contextual target action(s) consistent with existing onboarding behavior.
- request-AC13 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Catalog item deletion is blocked while referenced by a connector/splice.
- request-AC14 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Catalog item `connectionCount` reduction is blocked when it would invalidate linked connector/splice way/port usage.
- request-AC15 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Legacy fallback bootstrap behavior is applied consistently on both persisted load and import of older data.
- request-AC16 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: (Recommended V1) Catalog supports default sort by `manufacturerReference` and basic filtering on `manufacturerReference`/`name`.
- request-AC17 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: (Recommended V1) Catalog can open connector/splice creation flows prefilled from the selected catalog item.
- request-AC18 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: When no catalog item exists, connector/splice creation UI provides a clear blocking message and CTA to open/create catalog items.
- request-AC19 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Regression tests cover navigation access/order, required-field validation, legacy fallback bootstrap, connector/splice catalog integration behavior, and onboarding step/order integration.

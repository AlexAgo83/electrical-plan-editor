# Problem
`req_044` bundles many cross-cutting UI, analysis, sortability, theming, and hardening changes. A dedicated closure item is required to confirm final validation gates, AC traceability, and documentation sync.

# Scope
- In:
  - Run and record closure validation gates (lint/typecheck/tests/build/PWA/E2E + logics lint as applicable).
  - Confirm AC traceability for req_044 across delivered items.
  - Document final delivered scope and any explicit defers.
  - Sync related `logics` docs progress/status updates for req_044 artifacts.
- Out:
  - New feature implementation beyond req_044 scope.
  - Post-req_044 follow-up requests not yet planned.

# Acceptance criteria
- Final validation gates are executed and recorded.
- req_044 acceptance criteria traceability is documented.
- Delivery/defer outcomes are synchronized in related `logics` artifacts.

# Priority
- Impact: Medium-High.
- Urgency: Medium.

# Notes
- Dependencies: `req_044`.
- Blocks: none (closure item).
- Related AC: AC1-AC17 (traceability/closure).

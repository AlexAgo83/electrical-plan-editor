# Problem
Build output warns about oversized chunks, but there is no stable project-level bundle metric reporting/baseline to track regressions over time.

# Scope
- In:
  - Add bundle size reporting/checking that captures at least `main JS chunk` and `total JS gzip` metrics.
  - Introduce non-blocking warning thresholds/baselines before any hard fail thresholds.
  - Keep reporting output clear and actionable for CI and local use.
- Out:
  - Large code-splitting refactors (handled in `item_375`)
  - Hard blocking budgets in V1 unless low-risk and explicitly approved

# Acceptance criteria
- Bundle metrics (`main JS chunk`, `total JS gzip`) are reported consistently.
- Initial budget/baseline behavior is non-blocking and visible.
- Reporting integrates without regressing build/PWA quality gates.

# Priority
- Impact: Medium.
- Urgency: Medium.

# Notes
- Dependencies: `req_068`.

# AC Traceability
- request-AC1 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: A documented implementation plan exists for the review follow-ups (hardening, coverage visibility, bundle performance, test reliability, validation consistency).
- request-AC2 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: The fuse-wire reducer catalog linkage normalization path is hardened or explicitly validated as intentionally unchanged with rationale.
- request-AC3 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: UI coverage visibility is improved (even if initially non-blocking).
- request-AC4 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: A concrete bundle-size reduction strategy is implemented or a measured rationale is documented if deferred.
- request-AC5 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Known heavy/flaky UI tests are stabilized with targeted changes and no meaningful regression-signal loss.
- request-AC6 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Form validation strategy is clarified and applied to at least the reviewed inconsistent cases.
- request-AC7 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Catalog manufacturer-reference policy (including case-sensitivity expectation) is explicit and covered by implementation/tests or documented rationale.
- request-AC8 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: `test:ci` remains available as the canonical full-suite command while segmented test commands/reporting are added if adopted.
- request-AC9 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: The chosen default catalog `manufacturerReference` canonical comparison strategy (`trim + lower`, unless revised with rationale) is explicit.
- request-AC10 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Initial slow-test visibility is available (at least console top-N) to support targeted UI test stabilization prioritization.

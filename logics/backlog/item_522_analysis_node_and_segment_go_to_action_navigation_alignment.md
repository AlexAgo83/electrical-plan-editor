# Problem
`Node analysis` and `Segment analysis` expose related-entity tables, but unlike other analysis surfaces they do not provide row-level `Go to` actions to open the selected segment/wire directly.

# Scope
- In:
  - add an `Actions` column to the `Node analysis` associated-segment table with an iconized `Go to` button;
  - add an `Actions` column to the `Segment analysis` traversing-wire table with an iconized `Go to` button;
  - reuse the existing `Catalog analysis` visual/action pattern:
    - `validation-actions-cell`
    - `validation-row-go-to-button button-with-icon`
    - `action-button-icon is-open`
  - on activation:
    - `Node analysis` -> open `Segment` analysis and select the targeted segment;
    - `Segment analysis` -> open `Wire` analysis and select the targeted wire;
  - disable the action safely if the referenced entity is missing.
- Out:
  - broader redesign of analysis tables;
  - new navigation concepts outside the existing `Go to` pattern.

# Acceptance criteria
- AC1: `Node analysis` associated-segment rows expose a `Go to` action in an `Actions` column.
- AC2: Activating the `Node analysis` `Go to` action opens `Segment` analysis and selects the targeted segment.
- AC3: Missing-segment edge cases disable the `Go to` action safely.
- AC4: `Segment analysis` traversing-wire rows expose a `Go to` action in an `Actions` column.
- AC5: Activating the `Segment analysis` `Go to` action opens `Wire` analysis and selects the targeted wire.
- AC6: Missing-wire edge cases disable the `Go to` action safely.
- AC7: Both tables reuse the existing iconized `Go to` button pattern already used elsewhere in analysis/catalog flows.

# AC Traceability
- AC1/AC2/AC3/AC4/AC5/AC6/AC7 -> `src/app/components/workspace/AnalysisNodeSegmentWorkspacePanels.tsx`.
- AC7 -> `src/app/components/workspace/CatalogAnalysisWorkspaceContent.tsx`.
- request-AC1 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: `Network summary` BOM CSV export uses a UTF-8-compatible download payload and preserves accented/special characters in common spreadsheet clients.
- request-AC2 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Existing catalog-backed BOM rows remain exported in the same CSV without regression to current grouping/pricing behavior.
- request-AC3 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: The same BOM CSV export includes a second `Wire terminations` section after the existing BOM content.
- request-AC4 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: The `Wire terminations` section exports aggregated rows with headers `Type`, `Reference`, `Quantity`.
- request-AC5 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: `Connection` and `Seal` references are counted separately and aggregated by `type + reference`.
- request-AC6 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Empty/whitespace-only wire-side termination references are ignored and do not create rows.
- request-AC7 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Modeling wire CSV export includes `Begin connection ref`, `Begin seal ref`, `End connection ref`, `End seal ref`.
- request-AC8 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Analysis wire CSV export includes the same four columns in the same schema order.
- request-AC9 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Current wire CSV UTF-8 and CSV-safety behavior remains non-regressed.
- request-AC10 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: `Node analysis` associated-segment rows expose a `Go to` action for each segment.
- request-AC11 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Activating `Go to` from an associated-segment row opens the `Segment` analysis sub-screen and selects the targeted segment.
- request-AC12 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Missing-segment edge cases disable the `Go to` action safely instead of failing at runtime.
- request-AC13 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: `Segment analysis` traversing-wire rows expose a `Go to` action for each wire.
- request-AC14 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Activating `Go to` from a traversing-wire row opens the `Wire` analysis sub-screen and selects the targeted wire.
- request-AC15 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Missing-wire edge cases disable the `Go to` action safely instead of failing at runtime.
- request-AC16 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Export cartouche identity metadata is no longer unnecessarily truncated for ordinary-length values such as medium-length author names when export size allows readable layout.
- request-AC17 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: SVG and PNG exports follow the same cartouche metadata readability behavior.
- request-AC18 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Both new navigation tables use the existing `Actions` column + iconized `Go to` button pattern already used in `Catalog analysis`.
- request-AC19 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: On-screen plan rendering increases label distance from the stroke for horizontal and near-horizontal segments.
- request-AC20 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: Exported SVG follows the same horizontal/near-horizontal label-offset behavior as the on-screen plan.
- request-AC21 -> This backlog slice. Evidence needed: `logics_lint`, `lint`, `typecheck`, and relevant export/UI tests pass after implementation.

# Priority
- Impact: Medium-High.
- Urgency: Medium-High.

# Notes
- Derived from `logics/request/req_106_bom_export_wire_termination_coverage_wire_csv_termination_columns_and_horizontal_label_offset_harmonization.md`.
- Orchestrated by `logics/tasks/task_085_req_106_export_analysis_navigation_and_render_readability_orchestration_and_delivery_control.md`.
- Risks:
  - action-column insertion can affect compact/mobile table balance if spacing is not tuned;
  - navigation state bugs can appear if selection and sub-screen switching order are not kept deterministic.
- References:

  - `src/app/components/workspace/CatalogAnalysisWorkspaceContent.tsx`
  - `src/tests/app.ui.analysis-go-to-wire.spec.tsx`

# Delivery
- `Node analysis` associated-segment rows now expose an iconized `Go to` action that opens `Segment analysis` on the targeted segment.
- `Segment analysis` traversing-wire rows now expose the same `Go to` pattern to open `Wire analysis`.
- Missing referenced entities disable the action safely.

# Validation
- `npm test -- --run src/tests/app.ui.analysis-go-to-wire.spec.tsx`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`

# Problem
`req_043` groups multiple follow-up improvements after the successful baseline delivery of `req_035` through `req_042`. This backlog item tracks one execution slice of that follow-up bundle and records the delivery outcome for traceability.

# Scope
- In:
  - The work slice described by this item within `req_043` / `task_044`.
  - Implementation, targeted validation, and checkpoint commit recording for the associated wave.
  - Documentation traceability updates referencing the final outcome.
- Out:
  - Unrelated baseline rework from `req_035` through `req_042`.
  - Broader redesigns outside `req_043` follow-up scope.

# Acceptance criteria
- The scoped follow-up change is implemented (or explicitly deferred with rationale in task/request closure notes).
- Targeted validation for the touched scope is executed and recorded in `task_044`.
- The outcome is traceable to a checkpoint commit and/or final closure documentation.

# Priority
- Impact: Medium-High.
- Urgency: Medium.

# Delivery outcome
- Status: Delivered.
- Planned wave: Wave 7 / Final.
- Delivered in task_044 closure docs sync. This item documents the traceability update pass and follow-up mapping captured in `req_043` / `task_044`.
- See `logics/tasks/task_044_req_043_follow_up_phase_2_rollout_onboarding_polish_metadata_surfacing_test_hardening_and_doc_sync_orchestration.md` for validation snapshots and final gate traceability.

# Notes
- Dependencies: `req_043`, `task_044`.
